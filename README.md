## NBA Prediction
This is a project that try to predict, with the first year data of a NBA player, if the career of this player are going to pass the next five years. I used typical machine learning models for binary classification like logistic regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Ada, etc; as also a basic neural network in Keras.
